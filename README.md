### Iris Classification with a Decision Tree

This project demonstrates how to build, visualize, and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier for a multi-class classification problem. It uses the Iris dataset to predict the species of a flower based on its physical measurements.

* **Dataset**: The classic `Iris Dataset` from Scikit-learn, which includes features like sepal length/width and petal length/width.
* **Key Techniques & Concepts**:
    * **Model**: Training a `DecisionTreeClassifier`.
    * **Evaluation**: Calculating model accuracy, generating a confusion matrix, and creating a classification report.
    * **Visualization**: Creating a scatter plot for data exploration and a full plot of the resulting tree structure.
    * **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Comparing the performance of 'gini' vs. 'entropy' criteria and analyzing the effect of `max_depth` on accuracy.
* **Technologies Used**:
    * Python
    * Scikit-learn
    * Matplotlib
